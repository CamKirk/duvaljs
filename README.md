### Duval Triangle Plot

- If you're looking for just the duvalzones.json file, you can find it [here](https://gist.github.com/CamKirk/4f79620669c377e0962a12fdc6812f83)

- This is a personal project for generating a Duval Triangle using Plot.ly. If you'd like to run it, simply clone the repo, `npm i`, and then `node server.js`. Direct your browser to localhost:3000 and it should be there.

- A live site can be found at https://camkirk-duvaljs.herokuapp.com/

- Special thanks to Akbari _et al_ for publishing on ResearchGate, open access rocks!
